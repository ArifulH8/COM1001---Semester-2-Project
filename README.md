# About this project

This was created for our COM1001 Semester 2 Project. In this project we had to create an E-mentoring website using the Sinatra Ruby Web Framework.
It was initially developed to be used in a codio box. It has been changed to work in a more general environment.

## Prerequisites
Some applications are needed before you can start the web app  
``Ruby 2.6+``  
``Bundler Gem 2.0+``  
``Sqlite3 3.22+``  

# E-mentor scheme web application

A web application written in Ruby which allows mentors and mentees to contact each other and exchange information.

## To Start The Web App On Codio

-Visit <https://codio.com> and log into your account, or register first.

-Click on ‘My Projects’ and then on ‘New Project’.

-Select Ruby + Rails as the starting point and give your project a name, then create it.

-Open the terminal by clicking the "Tools" tab, then "Terminal". 

-Type the following commands in the terminal and press enter after each:

``git clone https://github.com/ArifulH8/COM1001---Semester-2-Project`` to clone the project to your system  

``cd COM1001---Semester-2-Project``

``gem install bundler``

``bundle install``

``ruby app.rb``

-Finally, go to the URL of your app, this will be printed to the terminal (‘This sinatra application is available at: *-*-4567.codio.io ‘).

-If you wish to stop the web app, press Control + C in the terminal located in the other tab, the codio box.

# For Non Codio Development 

A very similar process

``git clone https://github.com/ArifulH8/COM1001---Semester-2-Project`` to clone the project to your system

``cd COM1001---Semester-2-Project``

``gem install bundler``

``bundle install``

``ruby app.rb``

## Make an account

**Register** by visiting the login page, where you’ll be asked if you have an account, and enter your details to make one. 

Select your role based on what you would like to be: a mentor or a mentee.

## Contact a mentor

Mentees can use the **search and filter functions** to look for a suitable mentor.

They can enter an **introductory email** that will be sent to the mentor. 

As a mentee-driven scheme, it is their responsibility to initiate and maintain contact with your mentor.

## Mentor Acceptance

Mentors can go to their dashboard and **view the mentees** who have expressed their interest in a mentorship. 

They can click on **‘view more’** to see a description of the mentee and accept the invitation.

## Mentorship

Once the mentee and mentor have started the mentorship, they will be able to **see each others' emails** to start 
correspondence.

## Change account credentials

Use the **Profile** menu on the top tool bar to change your credentials.

Simply enter the new credentials and the old ones for verification purposes and the details will be updated
when you click Change Details.

## Administration

The administrator role is a **special role with elevated privileges**, such as suspending users, changing account details and viewing and dealing with reports.

The initial administrator (the ‘founder’) can also **promote other users**.

## The report system

Users can **submit reports** to administrators in case something inappropriate happens during the mentoring process. The administrators are then able to view the reports.
